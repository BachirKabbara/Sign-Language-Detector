# Sign Language Detector

## Overview
This project is a sign language detector built using MATLAB. It utilizes a webcam to capture live images and employs a neural network to classify English Sign Language gestures. The repository includes scripts for data collection, training, and testing the model.

## Features
- Real-time sign language detection
- Custom neural network model trained on the English Sign Language Alphabet
- Data collection script for expanding the training dataset

## Installation
To run this project, you need MATLAB installed along with the Image Processing and Neural Network Toolboxes.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-detector.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd sign-language-detector

## Usage
### Data Collection
Run `dataCollectionScript.m` to start collecting images from your webcam.

### Training the Model
Execute `trainingScript.m` to train the neural network with your dataset.

### Testing the Model
Launch `testScript.m` to classify new sign language gestures in real-time.
